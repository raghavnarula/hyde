## Hand Digit Recognizer (Tkinter)
Created a GUI App and predicted the handwritten digits on the screen using the MNIST Dataset which contains about 70000 images of numbers.


## Food Vision App 
Used Efficient Net-101 model for predicting the food items from the images. Developed a web app for the same.

• Used Food 101 Dataset.
• Classifies over 100 different food classes.
• 85% Accuracy

## Cardio Vascular Disease Prediction
• Cardio Vascular Disease Prediction on Kaggle Dataset with 70 000 records of patients data.
• Achieved an accuracy of 72.79 using Stacked Method (Gradient Boosting,Light Gradient Boosting, Ridge Classification).

## Youngistaan Dashboard
Created a personalized Dashboard for Youngsitaan Foundation as part of a 24-hour hackathon organized by JP Morgan. Finalists of Code For Good hackathon

## Lane Detection 
Detecting Lane lines is one of the most fundamental concepts for building a Self Driving Car. Used OpenCV to detect lane lines in a sample video sample obtained from a camera places on a car.
