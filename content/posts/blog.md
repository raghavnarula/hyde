In the process of preparing for GRE, tackling your weaknesses and channelizing your learning requires calculative methods. Here are a few ways you can amplify your learning and get the best out of your preparation:

**Focus on learning, not mugging:** Once you hook yourself with a GRE study schedule, you’re sure to be overwhelmed by the enormous GRE study material available online. However, you don’t have to be stressed about the quantity, rather focus on the quality. Study from official guides and books that convey concepts easily. Always remember that GRE is an aptitude test!

**Mix and match your course material:** GRE study material is available in the form of books, articles, online sample questions, CD’s, webinars, etc. And, there is no one way to get it right. Ensure that you are studying and choosing to learn from the ones that best serve you. You might enjoy reading the GRE book as well as learning online. The bigger your learning ground is, the greater your horizon! However, ensure you’re learning from a credible source.

**Practise as if this is your last attempt:** Challenge yourself! Write mock GRE tests like it’s your final attempt and check yourself. Mend your pressure points. Keep working on your weaknesses. Remember, you have to just keep learning and progressing.

**Work on your logical reasoning:** GRE doesn’t just test your bookish knowledge, it tests your smartness! The test assesses your methods and logic more than the number of formulas or steps you would have known. So, it is important that you train your mind to look at every question logically before rushing into solving it.

**Revamp the basics of English and Mathematics:** Brush up on the basics of grammar and math. It might sound redundant and unnecessary. But, it is highly recommended before the GRE test. In order to pace up with your answering, a refreshed memory of all the basic know-hows always comes in handy.

**Portals to your rescue:** Discussion portals online are a great place to build your learning community. To be able to learn together and help each other progress is a great method to opt while studying. If you wish to do the same, join the Yocket student community.
